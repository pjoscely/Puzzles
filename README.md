# Puzzles
Miscellaneous puzzles solved with code.

A Disclaimer:
Puzzles like this are often prescribed for the aging (me) to help maintain mental acuity. Personally, when I am able, I would rather code a program to solve a puzzle as opposed to actually solving it unless the puzzle is a crossword or like. 
The endless repetitive solving of word finds, sudoku, and similar seem a bit pointless, though it could very well be 
they are more effective at preventing dementia than programming a solution.
